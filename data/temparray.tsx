One you might regret in the morning, one you most definitely won't. \n\nTattu is a big kickass Asian fusion bar/restaurant in the heart of Spinningfields. These are interiors designed to be sexy, people, so Instagram at the ready. Think dark intricate woodwork, curved booths to get comfy and close on, plus some seriously fine foliage. Yep, a real cherry blossom tree takes centre stage. So it can stay pretty all year round then artificial leaves are attached by hand. That's the kind of attention to detail that we love.\n\nWe were immediately drawn to the mahogany backed bar like Argonauts to the Sirens. They got their game locked down - when we went, it was all about the Crouching Tiger. Gin, tequila and pink grapefruit make for an elegant yet powerful drink, just like its namesake. Or have an Asian-inspired aperitif in the form of the Cherry Blossom Negroni. \n\nCome for a hot date, bring your whole crew for a party, and if you're feeling peckish, the Lobster & Prawn toast and Wild Mushroom Spring Rolls rock. But it's the Giant King Prawn with Yuzu pepper and smoked garlic that'll have you going back for more.",

Skateboard tiles, retro posters, video clips of the pros getting air, mounted decks... a punk-rock loving teenager's dream, then. Gnarly.\n\nBarChick's tip? Arrive hungry. This is a spot for feasting. A 'go big or go home' attitude is advised over any calorie counting, that's for sure. We hope you like your meat cos these ribs ain't playing. Get sticky with the Baby Back Ribs coated in maple glaze, or order St Louis ribs by the bone. Boom. While you're gnawing on that you're gonna want to team it up with their insane sides – truffle cheese fries, popcorn shrimp, and burnt ends coated in their Hot As F*ck sauce. You get the idea. Time to wash all that goodness down with some serious booze. Go Tiki-tastic with their zombie (five rums and secret tiki juice - this is Lyndon's place after all). We couldn't resist going to the dark side with their Kentucky Dirtshake. Wild Turkey Whiskey, cacao, Patron XO, and Coco Pops half n' half. If the ribs didn't finish you off, this baby will. \n\nThinking of calling it a night? Er, there are two more floors to go. Hold out for Science & Industry and The Liars Lounge...",

We pulled up a big ol' leather chair and got friendly with the staff and the drinks menu.\n\nStart with an Old Cuban (Veuve Clicquot, Bacardi Gold, lime juice, sugar syrup, ginger syrup & mint leaves), Mal have nicknamed it the \"Bentley of Mojitos\" and you can see why… it's kinda fancy. The Malmaison Fizz (Bubble Time Champagne, Belvedere pink grapefruit vodka, Kamm & Sons ginseng & elderflower cordial) is summer in a glass and made Barchick want to slip into a bikini.\n\nHungry? Steak is truly Smoak's thang, get involved with a hunk of meat cooked in a Josper Grill - it's big, really hot (the grill, not the chef) and makes T-Bones taste incredible. When you're done with the booze and steak, get yourself a room upstairs and sleep it off… or something like that.",

If you have an early start, don't tell the barmen, they don't want to hear it. They're all about the good times and they'll be doing shots with you within minutes of you chatting to them. Leave your worries and inhibitions at the door.\n\nSure they have sugar skulls and various other Mexicany/Latin American bits and bobs donning the walls and the back bar, but this themed bar doesn't come across as tacky – they've managed to make it seem effortlessly cool.

This is probably the coolest beer garden you'll come across, it's grafittied and is fully kitted out with more booze and a load of retro games, foosball anyone?

The cocktails are good and mostly impressive, nearing the end of the night, BarChick ordered a Lemon Meringue Pie to satisfy her sweet tooth, that it did and then some.\n\nThis place is Italian through and through, from the chattering staff and the cicchetti (Venetian tapas), to the delicious and impressive selection of Italian wines which are divided into regions.\n\nCouple of warnings: despite the name, you can't smoke, and that pretty garden in the square outside is actually a graveyard, so not especially date/night-time friendly.",

The bar's sweeping and grand, the checked floor antique and beautiful, columns and pillars effortlessly support the structure and ivy seems to protrude from every orifice.\n\nLuckily the cocktails more than hold their own in these magical surroundings, and each page of the menu is as exciting as the next. BarChick, lost in Birmingham selected off the Lost page, whilst her date, who had found exactly what he was looking for chose off the latter. The White Truffle Honey & Tarragon Julep with Woodford Reserve Bourbon, Yellow Chartreuse, white truffle honey and fresh tarragon was delicious, and La Bonne Vie, seemed appropriate with its Absolut wild tea infused with camomile tea, St Germain elderflower liqueur, lemon juice, hibiscus syrup, tea pot bitters and Spanish bitters.\n\nDo stay for dinner, the food is excellent and you'll dine in a raised area which is perfect for spying over the rest of the explorers. Oh and be sure to visit the loos at some point, there's a whole street of them.\n\nWe'd happily get lost in here any day of the week, come find us.",

Their drinks selection is short and sweet, their cocktails won't blow you away but they do a mean Espresso Martini and a perfect Pimm's. They've got Flat Cap beers that bring you craft beers from the West Country/Czech Republic and a good selection of wine and beer. These guys are into their food and serve up some really delicious boards to share… go meaty, cheesy, fishy or mix it up with a bit of surf and turf. It's big on brunch and boasts a fine range of teas and barrista made coffee. With a late licence it's a great spot to hit after the theatre and quick enough if you fancy a pre culture hit cocktail.",

We went for a short sharp Boston Sour with Amaretto, apricot brandy, fresh lemon and sugar. If you're really not feeling boozy then they have a supportive menu of mocktails that are full of all the vitamins, and taste just as good (if you're a health freak that is). Down to party? They have a list of shot-tails that are short, sharp and at £2.50 well on their way to being dangerously easy to order.\n\nOh and make sure you hit the loos and go find Angel Gabriel. Just do it.",

Hot damn, Summer in The City looks mighty fine from where we were sat, and bonus feature: there ain't a bad seat in the house if you're hoping for cocktails with a view. This alfresco hot spot has brought not one but two outside terraces to the square mile. If the weather is looking sketchier than the gift shops in Leicester Square, head for the one with a retractable roof. You'll still be able to take in the rooftop sights, but you won't have the rain spoil your lunch.\n\nThe kitchen crew sure know how to put on a spread. Juicy Tandoori Monkfish Skewers and creamy Pea & Goats Cheese Arancini Balls with a pesto dip topped our highlight list, with honourable mentions going to the rich, thick cardamom & pistachio Kulfi Lollipop (think clotted cream meets India). All of that was washed down with their bright and elegant menu of cocktails. The Midsummer Margarita brings heatwave vibes with its addition of tart, fresh raspberry, but if you want a classic they'll make that for you, too.",

The meat is marinated in dried chillies, spices, achiote, and orange juice and then wrapped up in a corn tortilla - delicious. The El Pastór crew have their own special house marinade and have turned a whole mezzanine floor into a tortilla factory making their own freshly baked corn tortillas. \n\nThe booze list is bang on and mezcal heavy, (served neat with orange slices) - yes you can. If that's not your style, there are Mexican beers and Magaritas a-plenty. Looks-wise it's exactly what you'd expect with lots of colour and mixed woven fabrics reflecting bustling street-side taquerias and lively Mexican vibes. It's FUN.

You'll know you're in the right place once you've found the 5ft high illuminated keyhole at the bottom of a dark, unmarked staircase. Oh and the Do Not Disturb sign above the door. Ignore that and head on in. These guys want to be disturbed. \n\nOnce you're in on the secret, you'll find a den of old-school Manhattan glamour. Burgundy banquettes, leather bar stools, and moodily-hued walls. Vintage pictures of Follies chorus girls are beautifully encrusted with Swarovski beads, bringing the bling. Wanna impress a date? Yeh, this place will do that. Get cosy in one of the dark corners and check out the menu. It's a mix of barrel-aged sazeracs and negronis and sherry-spiked martinis served in stemless glasses balanced on ice.\n\nThere's a short but fantastic bar menu with a fusion of Asian and Mexican flavours; check out the truffled polenta fries; the crispy but tender buttermilk fried chicken with lime & jalapeño;  and the messy beef sliders. After something sweet? Give in to the peanut-butter & jelly ice cream sandwich. Retro US of A all the way.",

But if you can't afford the gondola ride, no worries. A restaurant and bar inspired by the dreamy Venetian original can be found in Marylebone. \n\nThe interior is sexy Italian meets convivial classic charm. Expect expensive elegant vibes, the kind where you feel pretty special. It's from the people behind The Ivy, J Sheekey, and the other Harry's Bar in Mayfair. You know, the one that's a private member's club and therefore nigh on impossible to get into unless you have serious hook ups. They've got sleek tan-leather seating, picture-plastered wood panelled walls, and the lighting is suitably low and romantic. At lunchtimes and in the evening it's a hubbub of excitable diners enjoying a swanky meal out. Expect groups of mates combined with a ton of daters making gooey eyes at each other.\n\nTake a seat on one of the banquettes and prepare for a feast that should probably involve their handmade pasta (Linguine Vongole, hello.) Or make like BarChick and prop yourself at the 1950s style bar - it's a beaut. The signature Negroni is hard to say no to, especailly when paired with a snack of truffle arancini.

Black iron lined windows stretch to the ceiling with its thick exposed piping. Centre stage is the bar; tiled and flanked by stools. Around the edge of the room its all about the pastel pink velvet armchairs and light turquoise sofas. That's where you'll find BarChick, chilling with her date and making her way through the fresh and creative cocktail menu. \n\nThe LINO Barrel Aged Negroni contains all the classic culprits, but it clearly spent its time in the barrel wisely, growing smooth and bold. The Rhubarb Spritz has a syrupy tang with vodka, rhubarb syrup, Campari and prosecco. They're big on mixing old classics and shaking up new combos, making the most of seasonal shrubs, herbs, fruits and veg. If the weather is grand, take this one to the terrace. It deserves to be drunk in the sunshine. Want a drink to match the furniture? The pastel green Grasshopper is rich and sweet, with it's moussey blend of vodka, menthe verte, cacao and half & half. It's hella creamy, you could have it as a pud following a few of the dishes, like the light bar snack of puffed pork skins, LINO kimichi and szechuan mayonnaise with it's salt n spicy vibes.  It had BarChick well and truly floored.",

That's talkin' our language, baby. On top of that (but actually below) is the second bar of the building which threw open its doors this summer. Like Dave Franco is to James,  Black Rock Tavern is the lighter casual answer to its darker basement brother, and it definitely shouldn't be taken any less seriously.\n\nWith bamboo ceiling panels and some unusual manga-style wall art complete with a few boozy tongue-in-cheek touches, this ground floor bar has chill Japanese izakaya vibes.  It's still about the whisky (phew!) but the menu centres on highballs and draught beers more than the hard-core stuff. Even still, our temptation took us to the cocktails. What can we say? The Bulleit based No Shake Sour got us shook with a savoury hit throwing shapes beneath the surface; they use Supasawa instead of citrus, and they've made it kick-ass and vegan-friendly with aquafaba instead of egg whites. Their Boulevardier gave a bitter hit but they made it tropical with a splash of passionfruit, but when we got to really craving a stiff one, we set our eyes on the back bar. It's a journey from smooth and sweet to smokey and peaty, and you can select by the dram. The crew are sh*t hot on their knowledge and the ultimate wing-men when it comes to hooking you up with your ideal whisky mate. Give the White Dog a go. It's young, but it's got the strength of Arnie in his heyday and will knock you off ya seat if you're not careful.",

Northbank is a suave little restaurant and bar hidden in plain sight beside the river, complete with a terrace - perfect for a spot of people watching. Bring it on.\n\nWhen the weather leaves a lot to be desired, grab a table inside, check yourself out in the mirrored bar and get cosy in the low light. If you like gin and you're partial to a few under-the-radar brands, hit up their speciality Cornish Gin menu. Whisky more your thing? Ask the bartender to mix up a Moonshine Monkey for ya. It's not on the menu, but tell 'em BarChick sent you and they'll be happy to get creative for you. They've stuck with the West Country vibes for this one by using Cornish Moonshine Whisky (its a high ABV young, white whisky), Galliano, Frangelico, Lavender & Chocolate Bitters, Maple Syrup and finished off with Prosecco.

When it comes to martinis that leave you in a pickle, these guys are leading the pack. It's all decked up in Edwardian style, the era in which their signature cocktail was created, but with hints of glam from the twenties and thirties as well as a cocktail menu that takes you on an epic journey through the decades right into the future, it's a head f*ck of a timewarp, and we're into it.\n\nFirst, let's talk Gibson cocktails. For those not familiar, they're gin martinis garnished with a pickled onion. Feisty. This is the jump off point for The Gibson. Let's say they've taken the classic recipe and run with it. Exhibit a): the Redistilled Gibson Martini. Star of Bombay and vermouth have been macerated with lemon zest, pickled onion and spices for 72 hours. BarChick knows people who have had relationships that are shorter than this. The result is a heady cocktail with unbelievable clarity.\n\nThen there's the Bullshot - the gin has had bone marrow added. Rich, umami-laden and complex - oh, and it's served in a vessel that looks like a pig's head. With a side of beef jerky. That's commitment to a theme, and we love it. In fact, unique serves are pretty standard for The Gibson. Here's a bar that's gonna get those Insta-likes stacking up, mark our words. You can find a drink served in the yellow blob of a Minion; a Bloody Mary in a loaf of bread; even a colour-changing neon lightbulb drink. But much like BarChick, these aren't style over substance. The ingredients cleverly mirror elements of the months of the year, so the menu is set out a little like a cocktail calendar. You have to love this annual approach to drinking.",
