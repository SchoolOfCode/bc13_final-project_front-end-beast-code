Cheersy is an app to help the evening enthusiast better find a watering-hole.  The main aim of the app is to help the user find bars of their specifications in a chosen location or area.  The main functionality is the user puts a location into the search input and receives a list back of bars from this area, they then can refine this search to their more specific requirements on the results page based on interests and tastes.
